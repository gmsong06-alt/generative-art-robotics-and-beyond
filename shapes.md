# Shapes in processing

## Rectangle
```rect(x, y, w, h)```
Replace x, y, w, h with numbers.

```x``` is how far across you want the shape. The greater the x, the more right the shape moves.  
```y``` is how far up or down you want the shape. The greater the y, the more down the shape moves (opposite of math)  
```w``` is how wide the shape is. The greater the w, the wider the shape.  
```h``` is how tall the shape is. The greater the h, the taller the shape.  

#### Example
```rect(20, 20, 50, 50)```  

## Ellipse
```elipse(x, y, w, h)```
Replace x, y, w, h with numbers.  

```x``` is how far across you want the shape. The greater the x, the more right the shape moves.  
```y``` is how far up or down you want the shape. The greater the y, the more down the shape moves (opposite of math)  
```w``` is how wide the shape is. The greater the w, the wider the shape.  
```h``` is how tall the shape is. The greater the h, the taller the shape.  

#### Example
```ellipse(20, 20, 50, 50)```

### Line
```line(x, y, x2, y2)```
Replace x, y, x2, y2 with numbers.  

```x, y``` is the starting coordinate of the line.  
```x2, y2``` is the ennding coordinate of the line.  

#### Example
```line(0, 0, 30, 30)```
